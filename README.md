This is a Buy event app

to run this PHP app, you need to run `php -f app.php` in the folder where app.php is located!

I used JSON to store info about orders and clients.

I chose the minimalist way to the problem as time was short.

I didn't connect to SMS services or didn't use PHP Mail to send the notifications. Because it would take more time!
